<h1 align="center">Cypress and Cucumber Automation Project :computer:</h1> 

### :question: What is it about?
This project is a set of automated tests performed on https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/index.htm. 
This website allowed me get my hands dirty with Cypress and the Cucumber preprocessor to implement Behavior-Driven Testing (BDT).
The goal was to apply what I learned during the course [Cypress with Cucumber BDD - Automation Testing Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/cypress-with-cucumber-bdd-beginner-to-expert-in-9-hours).
It runs everyday using GitHub Actions and the results can be checked [here](https://github.com/Mamr245/cypress-cucumber-automation-project/actions). 

### :hammer: Used Technologies
`Cypress` `Cucumber` `VSCode`

### :speech_balloon: Have any suggestions or have found an issue? 
Feel free to tell me about it :speech_balloon: I'm always looking to improve!
